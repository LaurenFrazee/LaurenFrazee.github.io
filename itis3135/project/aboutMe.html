                        As a Product Manager for Azure Network Security at Microsoft,
                        I leverage my technical and customer-facing skills to deliver innovative solutions
                        for enterprise cloud networking. I have over five years of experience in Azure IaaS a
                        nd PaaS technologies, with a specialized focus on Azure Networking services.

                    <p>
                        I am passionate about mentoring others to achieve more in their own space and educating people 
                        on how to identify opportunities. As a former Customer Engineer and Technical Advisor, I have 
                        supported and trained hundreds of Azure customers and engineers on best practices, architecture,
                        and troubleshooting. As a proud US Army veteran, I have served in various leadership and technical
                        roles in communications and IT support, and I am always eager to share my insights and guidance 
                        with those transitioning out of the military.
