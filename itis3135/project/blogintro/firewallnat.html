        <h3>Azure Firewall NAT Behaviors</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                The Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that can be integrated into many different use cases. It’s a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability that provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection. Depending on how traffic will flow through the Azure Firewall, there are expected NAT behaviors. NAT, or Network Address Translation, is a method of remapping an IP address into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets. When traffic passes through an Azure Firewall, the firewall can perform NAT to translate the source or destination IP addresses and ports of the packets. The specific NAT behavior will depend on the firewall’s configuration and the type of NAT being used. In this blog, we cover what behaviors to expect when traffic flows for inbound traffic, through DNAT rules, and for outbound traffic through the Network, and Application rules of the Azure Firewall.
