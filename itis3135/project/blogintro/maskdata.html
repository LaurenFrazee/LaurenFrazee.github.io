        <h3>Azure WAF – Masking Sensitive Data</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway provides centralized protection of web applications from common web application vulnerabilities. You can monitor how your Azure WAF resources are processing the traffic using the WAF logs which are written to the designated location i.e., Log Analytics Workspace, Storage Account, Partner Solution etc. These logs typically contain requests which are matched or blocked by the WAF rules and can provide valuable information for monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes. For ease of usage and analysis, WAF logs are written in plain text format by default. Client requests to web applications can also contain sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII). Potentially malicious requests from a client can be matched or blocked by WAF rules and subsequently written to the WAF logs along with any identifiable information in the request. PII includes data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and so on. If plain text logs are not properly scrubbed of such data, they could be at risk of unauthorized access and disclosure. Azure WAF log scrubbing tool helps you remove sensitive data from your WAF logs. It works by using a rules engine that allows you to build custom rules to identify specific portions of a request that contain sensitive data. Once identified, the tool scrubs that information from your logs and replaces it with *******. In this blog, we’ll cover examples of the log scrubbing feature using our Sensitive Data Lab you can find here.
