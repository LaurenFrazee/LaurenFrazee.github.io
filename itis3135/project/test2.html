Sure, here's how you can include the JavaScript code in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Mouseover Event</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeading">Hover over me!</h1>
<p id="myPara">And me!</p>

<script>
// Assign a function to be executed whenever the mouse pointer moves over any element in the document.
document.onmouseover = function (e) {

  // Declare a variable 'targ' to hold the target element.
  var targ;

  // If the event object 'e' is not present (which can happen in some older browsers), use the global 'window.event'.
  if (!e) var e = window.event;

  // If the event object has a 'target' property (which refers to the element that triggered the event), assign it to 'targ'.
  if (e.target) targ = e.target;

  // If the event object does not have a 'target' property but has a 'srcElement' property (which is another way to refer to the element that triggered the event, used in some older browsers), assign it to 'targ'.
  else if (e.srcElement) targ = e.srcElement;

  // If the 'targ' node is a text node (nodeType 3), this is due to an old Safari bug where the event target could be a text node instead of the actual element. To handle this, assign the parent of the text node (which should be the actual element) to 'targ'.
  if (targ.nodeType == 3) // defeat Safari bug
    targ = targ.parentNode;

  // Log the id of 'targ' to the console. This will be the id of the element that the mouse pointer is currently over.
  console.log(targ.id);
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

In this HTML document, there are two elements: an `h1` element with the id `myHeading` and a `p` element with the id `myPara`. When you hover over these elements, their ids will be logged to the console. You can replace these elements with your own HTML elements as needed. ðŸ˜Š
