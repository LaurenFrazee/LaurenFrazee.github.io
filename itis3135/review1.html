        <h2>Anessa Leng Project Review</h2>
        <p>
            My overall impression of the House of Leng’s webpages is that they are well-organized and aesthetically pleasing. The consistent design elements across the pages enhance the user experience, making navigation intuitive and straightforward. The contrast used in the design is great as it aids in distinguishing different sections effectively.

            However, there is room for improvement on the ‘About’ page. The readability of the text against the red background is somewhat compromised due to the lack of line spacing in the multi-line paragraphs. I would suggest increasing the ‘line-height’ to create some breathing space between the lines, which would significantly enhance the readability.
            
            Apart from this minor issue, the website is beautifully designed and functions smoothly. It’s clear that a lot of thought and effort has been put into it.
