        <h2>Nathan Pell Project Review</h2>
        <p>
            My overall impression of this site is that it is clear and concise. As a site that provides medical information, 
            the minimalist design of the site is highly appreciated.
            It successfully meets all the requirements outlined in the project assignment.
            However, I noticed a couple of minor issues that could be improved. 
            There is a typo in the H1 on the “Clinic Visit” page, and also in the first link under “Emergency Rooms”. 
            I particularly appreciate amount of whitespace and the banner in the header. It creates a sense of cohesion across all the pages, contributing to a unified and consistent user experience
